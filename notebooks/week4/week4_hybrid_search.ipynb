    "# Week 4: Document Chunking & Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We're Building This Week:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 4 transforms our BM25 keyword search (Week 3) into a hybrid search system that combines keyword matching with semantic vector similarity. This means \"deep learning optimization\" now also finds papers about \"neural network training\" — even when those exact words don't appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 4 Focus Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Objectives\n",
    "- **Section-Based Chunking**: Split papers into ~600-word overlapping segments that respect document structure\n",
    "- **Vector Embeddings**: Generate 1024-dim vectors via Jina AI for semantic similarity\n",
    "- **Hybrid Search**: Combine BM25 + KNN vector search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\n",
    "- **Production API**: Test the `/api/v1/hybrid-search/` endpoint end-to-end\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Test In This Notebook\n",
    "1. **Environment & Service Health** — Verify all Week 1-3 services + Jina API\n",
    "2. **Text Chunking** — Test TextChunker with real papers from PostgreSQL\n",
    "3. **Embedding Generation** — Generate real embeddings via Jina AI\n",
    "4. **Hybrid Indexing Pipeline** — Chunk → Embed → Index into OpenSearch\n",
    "5. **Search Modes** — Compare BM25 vs Vector vs Hybrid search\n",
    "6. **Production API** — Test the hybrid search endpoint\n",
    "7. **Performance Comparison** — Measure latency and result quality\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "3. **Hybrid Indexing Pipeline** — Chunk → Embed → Bulk index into OpenSearch\n",

    "   - **BM25**: Fast keyword matching (~50ms)\n",
    "   - **Vector**: Semantic similarity via KNN\n",
    "   - **Hybrid**: BM25 + Vector fused with RRF pipeline\n",
    "5. **Production API** — `/api/v1/hybrid-search/` with graceful degradation\n",
    "6. **Graceful Degradation** — Falls back to BM25 when embeddings fail\n",
